This tutorial will cover how to build Bixels;  
 
This document is about visualizing fluorescent proteins, which glow with a different colour when one colour of light hits them. They are widely used in biology as a research aid. 

In standard bio-labs you would use a transilluminator or platereader to visualize them which are wildly expensive. We will make a simple and very low-cost version of this which can be also used as a 8x8 biodisplay or as a STEAM education kit to get kids excited about biotechnology.

### Cardboard Box
Let's get started by creating the cover for bixels which is a simple cardboard box. I have chosen cardboard because it allows you to quickly iterate and customize the design without the need of any equipment such as a 3D printer. 

You can either lasercut your parts or print the PDF on a A4 sheet and cut it out by hand. Use a non see-through cardboard! Test it out beforehand and hold it against the light. No light should be able to get through. I use [Mountboard from Daler Rowney](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Daler-Rowney-Black-Graduate-Mountboard/dp/B00GKCF0VG/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=mount+board+black&qid=1571151582&sr=8-4) because it allows you to make neat hinges. You can also add a layer of black thin cardboard on each side if your cardboard let's any light through, use sprayglue for laminating it on top.
 
For the lasercut
Download the file here. The red lines are for engraving the cardboard to easier fold it. The black lines are cuts. We suggest to test your two settings in a small corner beforehand.
 
For cutting it by hand
Download the file here. Print it on an A4 paper and mount it on a thicker cardboard. You don’t want anything moving. We suggest to use (removable) spray-mount for it. To make the holes for the PCR matrix use a hole puncher. It is much more painful than laser-cutting but possible.
 
Folding the boxes
Bixels is made of 3 parts. The main box for the electronics, the filterbox to turn it into a transilluminator and our PCR matrix to hold your PCR strips in place.
 
First let's fold the main box:

Now let’s fold the filter box:
Glue the orange filter first - that makes it easier.
